**Prompt Engineering** is the art of **creating effective prompts** so that an **Artificial Intelligence** (AI) can serve your needs. [There are many Prompting techniques](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/que-es-prompt-engineering) you can use to become a great **Prompt Engineer**. This essay will cover some of the most important aspects of Prompt Engineering and provide you with some tips on how to become a great Prompt Engineer.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt Engineering is the **process of creating effective prompts** so that an AI can serve your needs. It involves understanding the capabilities of the AI and using that knowledge to create prompts that generate the desired outcome. **Prompt Engineering** is a skill that can be learned and developed over time. It requires creativity, critical thinking, and a deep understanding of the AI's capabilities.

When creating a prompt, it is important to consider the following:

- **The main objective**: What exactly do you want the AI to do?
- **The context**: What data do you need to provide to the AI to understand the task?
- **Clarity**: Is the prompt clear and unambiguous?
- **Constraints**: The output of the model used may have a character or token limit; each model accepts different types of inputs such as images, audio, or text.
- **Output structure**: If you need to produce an output in a specific format, consider providing an example so the model can understand your requirement.

If you can answer these questions, you are well on your way to becoming a great Prompt Engineer and creating effective prompts.

## What Does a Prompt Engineer Do?

As a Prompt Engineer, your job essentially involves **writing, executing, and refining prompts**. Comparing how a prompt works with different models, different data, different delimiters, etc. You will also need to experiment with different prompts to see which ones work best for your needs. A Prompt Engineer is always looking for ways to improve their prompts and make them more effective. Sometimes short prompts work better, sometimes long prompts work better. It all depends on the task at hand, the necessary context, and the desired outcome. Often, you may even need to be more or less specific depending on the model you are using.

> Prompt Engineering involves a constant process of experimentation, writing, executing, and refining prompts.

Generally, **a longer prompt will provide more context to the AI**, which can help it generate a more accurate and relevant result. However, a longer prompt can also introduce more noise and make it harder for the AI to generate the desired result. That is why it is so important to use the [appropriate prompting techniques](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/que-es-prompt-engineering).
