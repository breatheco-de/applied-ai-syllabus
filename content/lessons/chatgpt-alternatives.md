## 6. Free Local AIs

There are several artificial intelligence alternatives that you can run locally on your computer, allowing you to have full control over your data and privacy. Here are some models you can run locally using Ollama to run them and OpenWebUI for the user interface.

### Available Models
- **Llama 3.1**: A state-of-the-art model from Meta available in sizes of 8B, 70B, and 405B parameters.
- **Gemma 2**: An efficient and high-performance model from Google available in three sizes: 2B, 9B, and 27B.
- **Mistral-Nemo**: A 12B parameter model with a context length of 128k, developed by Mistral AI in collaboration with NVIDIA.
- **Phi-3**: A family of lightweight models from Microsoft available in sizes of 3B and 14B parameters.

### Tools to Run AI Locally
- **OpenWebUI**: Allows you to have a ChatGPT-like interface completely locally. It also allows you to add an OpenAI key to use OpenAI models like GPT-4. You can interact with the Ollama API locally, so you can have an interface and your models running locally without issues. [Download OpenWebUI here](https://openwebui.com/)
- **Ollama**: Allows you to run various artificial intelligence models locally, as mentioned above. It deploys an API similar to OpenAI's that you can interact with and also integrates a library for Python.

## Differences between Local and Cloud AI

### Privacy

- **Local AI**: Running AI models locally offers greater privacy as data is not sent to external servers.
- **Cloud AI**: Data is processed on remote servers, which can be a privacy concern.

### Performance

- **Local AI**: Depends on your computer's hardware, which can limit performance.
- **Cloud AI**: Generally offers superior performance thanks to scalable infrastructure.

### Flexibility

- **Local AI**: Greater control over model configuration and customization.
- **Cloud AI**: Less control, but easier to use and scale.

## Make the Most of Any AI Model

To effectively interact with language models, it is essential to understand how to use "prompts." A "prompt" is an instruction or set of instructions given to an artificial intelligence model to generate a response. Prompts can vary in complexity and detail and are fundamental to obtaining precise and useful results from AI models.

### Prompting Techniques

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Ensure your prompt is clear and concise. Avoid ambiguities and provide all necessary information for the model to understand the context.
2. **Context**: Provide enough context for the model to generate a relevant response. This can include background information, specific details, and any other pertinent information.
3. **Specific Instructions**: Give specific instructions on what you expect from the model. For example, if you need a list, explicitly ask for a list.
4. **Iteration**: Do not hesitate to iterate on your prompts. If the response is not as expected, adjust the prompt and try again.

## Conclusion

These six alternatives to ChatGPT offer a variety of features that may be more suitable for different needs and preferences. From the ability to generate large amounts of text to integration with image generation tools and local execution for greater privacy, these options allow you to explore the world of artificial intelligence more broadly.
