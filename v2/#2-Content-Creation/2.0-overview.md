Alright, time to get visual! This is where things get really exciting. We're talking about **AI Image Generation**—the technology that's turning everyone into an artist, regardless of whether you can draw a stick figure or not.

Generating images with AI depends on your outcome, but the process is usually the same:

- Choose a tool
- Choose workflow
- Write a prompt
- Add example images if possible
- Get a result

There are many tools and models out there to create images, some of them are better for particular tasks.

### ChatGPT
