## The AI Content Creation Revolution

We're living in a golden age of creativity. AI tools have democratized content creation, making it possible for anyoneâ€”regardless of technical skillâ€”to produce professional-quality content.

## How AI Generates Content

There are two main approaches to AI content creation:

### 1. **Raw Generation**

Content generated directly by a model. Think of this as asking an AI to "paint a sunset" or "write a story about a robot." The AI creates something entirely new based on your description.

### 2. **Composed Generation**

Content crafted by a model using building blocks. This is like having an AI assistant that takes your ideas and helps you structure, refine, and polish them into something amazing.

## What This Course Covers

We'll explore the full spectrum of AI content creation:

- **Images** - Generate, edit, and manipulate visuals
