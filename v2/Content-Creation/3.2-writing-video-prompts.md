Now we’re getting to the heart of AI video generation! Writing effective prompts for video is similar to image prompts, but with the added complexity of movement, time, and action. The better you can describe what you want to see in motion, the more likely you are to get compelling video content.

Video prompts need to communicate not just what something looks like, but how it moves and changes over time. Think of your prompt as a director’s script for a short film.

### **Core Building Blocks for Video**

Every effective video prompt should include these fundamental elements:

1. **Subject** – What are we seeing?  
   > Example: "A cat"
2. **Action or movement** – What is happening and how?  
   > Example: "A cat walking"
3. **Setting** – Where is this happening?  
   > Example: "A cat walking through a garden"
4. **Style** – What does it look like?  
   > Example: "A cat walking through a garden, animated style"
5. **Mood** – How does it feel?  
   > Example: "A cat walking through a garden, animated style, peaceful and serene mood"
6. **Camera movement** – How does the camera move?  
   > Example: "A cat walking through a garden, animated style, peaceful and serene mood, camera slowly follows the cat"

## Essential Elements of a Video Prompt Explained

### **1. Subject Description**

Be specific about what you want to see in motion:

**Good examples:**

- "A young woman with flowing red hair"
- "A vintage steam locomotive"
- "A futuristic robot with glowing blue eyes"

**Vague examples:**

- "A person" (too generic)
- "A vehicle" (not specific enough)
- "Something cool" (AI doesn’t understand "cool")

### **2. Action and Movement**

Describe what your subject is doing and how:

**Good examples:**

- "Gracefully walking across a field"
- "Gently floating in space"
- "Slowly spinning with a trail of sparkles"
- "Growing from a seed to a full tree"

**Vague examples:**

- "Moving" (not specific enough)
- "Doing something" (not helpful)
- "In motion" (what kind of motion?)

### **3. Movement Quality**

Specify how the movement should feel:

**Types of movement:**

- "Smooth and fluid"
- "Jerky and mechanical"
- "Gentle and peaceful"
- "Fast and energetic"
- "Slow and deliberate"

**Movement patterns:**

- "Circular motion"
- "Linear movement"
- "Wavelike patterns"
- "Pulsating rhythm"
- "Seamless transitions"

### **4. Setting and Environment**

Place your subject in a context with movement:

**Good examples:**

- "In a cozy café with steam rising"
- "Atop a mountain with clouds passing by"
- "Inside a spaceship with stars flowing past"

**Vague examples:**

- "Somewhere nice" (AI doesn’t know what "nice" means)
- "In a place" (too generic)
- "Outside" (not specific enough)

### **5. Artistic Style**

Specify the visual approach you want:

**Video styles:**

- "Cinematic"
- "Animated"
- "Photorealistic"
- "Artistic"
- "Minimalist"

Have a style not listed here? Let me know!

**Specific artistic movements:**

- "Impressionist style"
- "Cyberpunk aesthetic"
- "Vintage film look"
- "Modern digital art"

### **6. Pacing**

Specify how long the video should be and its pace:

**Pacing descriptions:**

- "Slow and meditative"
- "Fast-paced and energetic"
- "Smooth and flowing"
- "Dynamic and exciting"

### **7. Lighting and Atmosphere**

Set the mood with lighting descriptions:

**Types of lighting:**

- "Golden hour lighting"
- "Dramatic shadows"
- "Soft ambient light"
- "Neon lighting"
- "Candlelight"

**Atmospheric elements:**

- "Mysterious and melancholic"
- "Bright and cheerful"
- "Dark and dramatic"
- "Peaceful and serene"

## Advanced Prompting Techniques for Video

### **Negative Prompts for Video**

Tell the AI what you DON’T want:

**Examples:**

- "No text or words"
- "No human faces"
- "No complex backgrounds"
- "No fast camera movements"

### **Technical Video Specifications**

Add technical details for better results:

**Camera movements:**

- "Static camera, no movement"
- "Smooth pan from left to right"
- "Slow zoom in"
- "Stable handheld camera feel"

**Video quality:**

- "High resolution"
- "Smooth 30fps"
- "Professional quality"
- "Cinematic look"

### **Reference Styles and Motions**

Reference specific video styles:

**Examples:**

- "Like a Studio Ghibli animation"
- "Similar to a nature documentary"
- "In the style of a music video"
- "Like a vintage film reel"

## Video Prompt Templates for Common Use Cases

### **Nature and Landscape Videos**

```
"[Scene description], [weather conditions], [movement elements], [lighting], [art style], [mood], [duration]"
```

**Example:**
"A serene mountain lake with gentle ripples, soft clouds moving across the sky, golden hour lighting, watercolor painting style, peaceful and calm mood, 12 seconds long"

### **Character Animation Videos**

```
"[Character description] [action] in [setting], [movement style], [lighting], [mood], [art style], [duration]"
```

**Example:**
"A friendly robot waving in a futuristic garden, smooth mechanical movements, soft blue lighting, cheerful and welcoming mood, digital art style, 8 seconds long"

### **Abstract and Pattern Videos**

```
"[Pattern description], [type of movement], [color scheme], [style], [mood], [duration]"
```

**Example:**
"Fluid geometric shapes in blue and green, gentle wavelike movement, vibrant neon colors, minimalist style, calming and meditative mood, 15 seconds long"

## Pro Tips for Better Video Results

### **Start Simple**

- Begin with basic movements
- Add complexity gradually
- Master fundamental motion before complex scenes

### **Be Specific About Motion**

- Instead of "moving," use "floating," "spinning," or "flowing"
- Instead of "fast," use "quick," "speedy," or "energetic"
- Instead of "slow," use "gentle," "leisurely," or "meditative"

### **Consider the Timeline**

- Think about what happens from start to finish
- Describe the beginning, middle, and end of the movement
- Specify how the action evolves over time

### **Use Motion Adjectives**

- "Flowing," "bouncing," "swaying," "pulsating"
- "Gliding," "twisting," "expanding," "contracting"
- "Rising," "falling," "spinning," "floating"

Remember, video prompting is a skill that improves with practice. Don’t get discouraged if your first attempts don’t give you exactly what you want. Each generation teaches you something new about how to communicate with AI for video creation.
