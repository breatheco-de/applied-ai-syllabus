## Writing Prompts for Images: The Art of Getting What You Want üéØ

## Anatomy of a Great Image Prompt

Think of your prompt as a recipe. Just as a recipe needs clear ingredients and instructions, your prompt should include specific details the AI can understand and follow.

### **Main Building Blocks**

Every effective image prompt should aim to answer:

1. **Subject** ‚Äî Who or what is in the image?
2. **Action** ‚Äî What are they doing?
3. **Setting** ‚Äî Where is it happening?
4. **Style/Medium** ‚Äî How should it look?
5. **Mood/Lighting** ‚Äî What feeling or atmosphere should the image have?

## From Simple to Specific‚ÄîPrompt Structure

Let‚Äôs see how prompts evolve from basic to advanced:

### **Level 1: Simple Prompt**
```
"A cat"
```
*Result: A generic cat, with random style and background.*

---

### **Level 2: Descriptive Prompt**
```
"Fluffy orange cat sitting on a windowsill"
```
*Result: A more specific scene and subject.*

---

### **Level 3: Detailed Prompt**
```
"Fluffy orange cat with green eyes sitting on a sunlit windowsill, looking out into a garden, photorealistic"
```
*Result: Clear subject, action, setting, and style.*

## Tips for Creating Effective Prompts

- **Short and Simple Wins:** Use concise, clear phrases. Avoid long lists or never-ending sentences.
- **Choose the Right Words:** Use precise adjectives and synonyms. Instead of "nice," try "cozy," "elegant," or "vibrant."
- **Use Specific Numbers:** "Three cats" is clearer than "cats."
- **Emphasize What You Want:** Focus your prompt on what should be present, not on what to exclude.
- **Be Clear About Details:** Mention elements that matter to you‚Äîsubject, style, setting, color, mood, composition.
- **Reference Real Things:** "Like a sunset in Hawaii" is more effective than "beautiful sunset."

Add details for higher quality or specific results:
