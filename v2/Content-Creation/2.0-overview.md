Alright, it’s time to get visual! This is where things get really exciting. We’re talking about **AI Image Generation**—the technology that’s turning everyone into an artist, whether you can draw a stick figure or not.

Generating images with AI depends on your experience with the topic—you might know which keywords to use or which models are best for your task, but the process is usually the same:

- Choose an image generation tool
- Write a prompt for the image you want to generate
- Get a result

In some cases, you can use previous images and give them an AI touch, like with ChatGPT.

There are many tools and models available for creating images, some of which are better suited for particular tasks.

### ChatGPT

**ChatGPT** is an all-in-one conversational AI platform that now includes robust image generation and editing features. Through its natural language interface, you can generate, refine, and edit images simply by typing instructions.

- **Image Generation:** Create original images from detailed prompts using DALL-E and GPT-Image models (you won’t even notice which one it uses, but I’m telling you.)
- **Editing and Iteration:** Make changes easily (“add a hat,” “make it nighttime”) and see instant results.
- **Text in Images:** GPT-Image excels at inserting high-quality, legible text—something most diffusion models struggle with.
- **Accessibility:** Works in the browser, no extra installation required.
- **Integration:** Combine text, images, and code in a single workflow, making it perfect for brainstorming, prototyping, and presentations.
- **Limitations:** Less specialized for detailed art styles than some purpose-built tools.

_Best for_: Rapid ideation, mixed-media projects, and users wanting a seamless text-to-image workflow. Great for banners or product images.

### Midjourney

**Midjourney** has evolved from a Discord-only tool into a fully functional web platform for AI art generation and editing.

- **Image Generation:** Create highly artistic and imaginative images from prompts—Midjourney is famous for its unique, often surreal output, though you can achieve almost any result with the right prompt.
- **Image Editing:** Use the built-in editor to modify, remix, pan, and expand your images. Easily change style, composition, and details.
- **Prompt Power:** Tweak results with advanced parameters (aspect ratio, chaos, weights, etc.), image prompts, and style/character references. You can use previous images to generate similar ones.
- **Workflow:** Use the web interface or Discord bot to generate and organize your visuals.
- **Video Capabilities:** Generate short video animations from images.
- **Limitations:** Some advanced controls require learning specific syntax; struggles with precise text rendering.
- **Community and Customization:** Create mood boards, folders, and custom styles; join a vibrant community to share and explore. In the community, you can see details on generated images and the prompts used for inspiration.

_Best for_: Artists, designers, and anyone seeking visually striking, creative, and customizable AI-generated images. Useful for generating multiple images of the same product or character.

### Leonardo AI

**Leonardo AI** is a comprehensive creative platform designed for both professionals and enthusiasts, offering much more than just image generation.

- **Image and Video Generation:** Create stunning artwork, concept designs, illustrations, and even videos with a variety of state-of-the-art models.
- **Canvas Editor:** Edit, enhance, and expand images directly on the platform. Add objects, text, or extend artwork beyond its original edges.
- **Training:** Upload your own images to train custom models, aligning output with your unique style or brand.
- **Resolution Enhancement:** Use the Universal Upscaler to boost the resolution and detail of any artwork, making it print-ready or suitable for large screens.
- **3D and Animation:** Generate 3D objects from text or images, and animate images using AI-powered keyframe interpolation.
- **Asset Management:** Organize, edit, and manage large batches of assets for games, marketing, or creative projects.
- **Community and Templates:** Access community-trained models, templates, and reusable setups to speed up your workflow.
- **Limitations:** Advanced features may require a paid subscription; there’s a learning curve to mastering all the tools.

_Best for_: Artists, illustrators, game developers, creative agencies, and anyone needing high-quality, consistent, and customizable visual assets at scale. Useful for generating multiple images of the same product or character.
