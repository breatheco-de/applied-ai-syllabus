## How Does Audio Summary Generation Work in NotebookLM?

Let’s break it down, step by step, because I know you might have questions. Here’s the process, explained in plain English:

1. **Create or open a notebook** in NotebookLM.
2. **Upload your sources:** these can be articles, PDFs, presentations, notes—anything relevant to your topic.
3. **Go to the “Studio” panel** and select the “Audio Summary” section.
4. **Customize the duration:** choose whether you want a shorter, default, or longer audio summary.
5. **Generate the summary:** just hit “Generate” and NotebookLM will create a conversation between virtual hosts summarizing the key points from your sources.
6. **Focus the topic:** if you want the summary to concentrate on a specific aspect, use the “Customize” option and enter your instructions or questions.

> _Note:_ Audio summaries are **objective** and faithfully reflect the content of your sources—they’re not the hosts’ personal opinions. Of course, as with any technology, there may be inaccuracies, so always review the final result.
