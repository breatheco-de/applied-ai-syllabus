# Email Classification Workflow

Ready to turn your email inbox from a chaotic mess into a well-organized, automated system? Today we're building an **intelligent email classification workflow** that will save you hours every week and ensure nothing important falls through the cracks.

## The Email Problem: Why We Need This ü§î

Let me start with a question: *How many emails do you receive daily?* 

If you're like most professionals, the answer is probably 50-200 emails per day. Now, let me ask another question: *How many of those emails actually require your immediate attention?*

The reality is that **80% of emails are either spam, informational, or can be handled by someone else**. That's where our AI-powered email classification workflow comes in!

### The Email Classification Challenge

Traditional email management is like trying to drink from a firehose:
- **Important emails** get buried in the noise
- **Urgent requests** are missed or delayed
- **Time is wasted** on low-priority messages
- **Stress levels** skyrocket from inbox overload

*Our solution? Let AI do the heavy lifting of sorting and prioritizing, so you can focus on what matters most.*

## How AI Email Classification Works üß†

Let me break down the magic behind intelligent email classification:

### **The Classification Process**

1. **Email arrives** in your inbox
2. **AI analyzes** the content, sender, subject, and context
3. **Email is categorized** based on priority and type
4. **Automated actions** are triggered based on classification
5. **You receive** only the emails that need your attention

### **What AI Looks For**

AI classification considers multiple factors:
- **Sender importance**: VIP contacts, clients, team members
- **Subject line patterns**: Urgent keywords, project names, deadlines
- **Content analysis**: Request indicators, question marks, action items
- **Historical patterns**: How you've handled similar emails before
- **Time sensitivity**: Deadlines, meeting requests, time-sensitive content

## Building Your Email Classification Workflow üèóÔ∏è

Now let's build this step by step. I'll show you how to create a comprehensive email classification system using Zapier and AI.

### **Step 1: Define Your Email Categories**

First, let's establish clear categories for your emails:

#### **Priority Levels**
- **üî• Critical**: Requires immediate attention (client emergencies, deadlines)
- **‚ö° High**: Important but not urgent (project updates, client requests)
- **üìã Medium**: Informational or can wait (newsletters, updates)
- **üìÅ Low**: Can be archived or delegated (spam, general info)

#### **Email Types**
- **üíº Client/Work**: Business-related communications
- **üë• Team**: Internal team communications
- **üìß Marketing**: Newsletters, promotions, updates
- **üîß Support**: Technical issues, help requests
- **üìÖ Scheduling**: Meeting requests, calendar updates
- **üìä Reports**: Data, analytics, status updates

### **Step 2: Set Up Your Zapier Workflow**

Let's create the main classification Zap:

#### **The Workflow Structure**
```
Trigger: New email in Gmail
Filter 1: Check sender importance
Filter 2: Analyze subject line
Filter 3: Check for urgent keywords
Action 1: Apply labels/categories
Action 2: Send to appropriate folder
Action 3: Trigger notifications
Action 4: Create follow-up tasks
```

#### **Step-by-Step Setup**

1. **Create New Zap**
   - Trigger: Gmail ‚Üí New Email
   - Connect your Gmail account

2. **Add Filters for Classification**
   - **Sender Filter**: Check if sender is in VIP list
   - **Subject Filter**: Look for urgent keywords
   - **Content Filter**: Analyze email body for action items

3. **Set Up Conditional Actions**
   - **Critical emails**: Send to "Urgent" folder + Slack notification
   - **High priority**: Send to "Action Required" folder + task creation
   - **Medium priority**: Send to "Review Later" folder
   - **Low priority**: Archive or send to "Reference" folder

### **Step 3: Advanced AI Classification with ChatGPT**

Now let's add some real AI intelligence to our classification:

#### **AI-Powered Classification Zap**

```
Trigger: New email in Gmail
Action 1: Send email content to ChatGPT
Action 2: Get AI classification and priority score
Action 3: Apply AI recommendations
Action 4: Execute automated actions
```

#### **ChatGPT Prompt for Email Classification**

Here's a powerful prompt to get consistent email classifications:

```
You are an email classification expert. Analyze this email and provide:

1. Priority Level (1-5, where 1 is critical, 5 is low)
2. Email Type (client, team, marketing, support, scheduling, report)
3. Urgency (immediate, today, this week, later)
4. Required Action (respond, delegate, archive, schedule follow-up)
5. Estimated Response Time (how long to handle this email)

Email Content:
[EMAIL_CONTENT]

Respond in JSON format:
{
  "priority": 1-5,
  "type": "email_type",
  "urgency": "urgency_level",
  "action": "required_action",
  "response_time": "estimated_time"
}
```

## Real-World Email Classification Examples üåç

Let me show you some practical examples of how this system works:

### **Example 1: Client Emergency Email**
```
Email: "URGENT: Website is down, losing customers!"
AI Classification: Priority 1, Type: Client, Urgency: Immediate
Actions: 
- Move to "Critical" folder
- Send Slack alert to support team
- Create urgent task in project management tool
- Send auto-response to client acknowledging urgency
```

### **Example 2: Team Update Email**
```
Email: "Weekly project status update - all on track"
AI Classification: Priority 3, Type: Team, Urgency: This week
Actions:
- Move to "Review Later" folder
- Add to weekly review task list
- No immediate notification needed
```

### **Example 3: Newsletter Email**
```
Email: "Industry insights: 5 trends to watch in 2024"
AI Classification: Priority 5, Type: Marketing, Urgency: Later
Actions:
- Move to "Newsletters" folder
- Schedule for weekend reading
- No immediate action required
```
